# angular-wallet

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
Running `./node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor test/protractor-conf.js` will run E2E tests.
You can run `npm install protractor -g` so you don't need to run it from local `node_modules`
More information on how to set up protractor [here](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/)
